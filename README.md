Hotel-Management-Software
=========================

I have developed a desktop based hotel management system using vb.net 2010 and oracle database which can take entry of the customers, calculate total cost, update services taken by the customer, search customer detail with name, id, room no and address, show the list of all customer and check out providing a receipt.
You can see the snapshots of the software.
The code is not given because it is my b.tech 3rd year course project and is confidential.
